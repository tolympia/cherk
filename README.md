## Introduction
## Process
#### Arriving at our idea

#### Doing research
In order to create an algorithm to solve our problem, it was necessary to do some research, in order to better understand the necessary information to complete this project. The first part of our research was an interview with the AP Exam coordinator at GA, Ms. Burman. While interviewing Ms. Burman, our group asked her a series of questions, including how long it takes her to create an AP exam proctor schedule, what she looks for when deciding who proctors each AP exam, what teachers are able to proctor what exams, and if teachers are able to switch who proctors an exam at a certain point. Once she answered each of the questions in detail, we were able to begin to come up with a plan on how we wanted our program to work. We determined that teachers often proctor exams during their free blocks and teachers are able to switch off proctoring exams. Subsequently, we were able to create an algorithm that takes in all the AP teachers and their free blocks in one file and all the AP exams with their date and time in another file, and produce an exam proctoring schedule, that assigns teachers with free blocks that fall during the time of an exam to proctor them.  

##### DateTime Library
Originally we wanted to avoid using to many Java API's. These are packages that contain prewritten code that we can implement in our projects. However, reaserching these packages contain time, and we wanted to focus more on the actual planning and coding part. However, we needed to use the DateTime library when coding our project. 

#### Creating big goals and outlining 
#### Execution
### Program Goals/Design
The primary goal of our project was to make Ms. Berman and our AP teachers' lives easier when it comes to scheduling proctors for AP exams. Our goal was to almost eliminate the tedious process that Ms. Berman undertakes every year when she matches AP teachers and their frees with when AP exams are. In an ordinary year, Ms. Berman would start with the AP exam time, look up the blocks that the AP Exam took place in, search througha lit of AP teachers to find those who have the blocks free, and then reach out to the teacher to ensure they did not have a conflict during this time. Other things to consider were if the teacher had young kids and needed to pick them up in the afternoon, if the teacher had alread proctored another exam, and if the department the taught in conflicted with the department that the AP Exam would fall under. We wanted to simplify this task by creating an AP Exam Schedule Maker to avoid the guess and check process by taking teacher's names, frees, and departments as well as the AP Exam schedule and returning the potential list of proctors for each exam that Ms. Berman could then use to determine who she would like to proctor.
