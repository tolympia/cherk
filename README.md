## Process
#### Arriving at our idea
#### Doing research

#####DateTime Library
Originally we wanted to avoid using to many Java API's. These are packages that contain prewritten code that we can implement in our projects. However, reaserching these packages contain time, and we wanted to focus more on the actual planning and coding part. However, we needed to use the DateTime library when coding our project. 

#### Creating big goals and outlining 
#### Execution
### Program Goals/Design
The primary goal of our project was to make Ms. Berman and our AP teachers' lives easier when it comes to scheduling proctors for AP exams. Our goal was to almost eliminate the tedious process that Ms. Berman undertakes every year when she matches AP teachers and their frees with when AP exams are. In an ordinary year, Ms. Berman would start with the AP exam time, look up the blocks that the AP Exam took place in, search througha lit of AP teachers to find those who have the blocks free, and then reach out to the teacher to ensure they did not have a conflict during this time. Other things to consider were if the teacher had young kids and needed to pick them up in the afternoon, if the teacher had alread proctored another exam, and if the department the taught in conflicted with the department that the AP Exam would fall under. We wanted to simplify this task by creating an AP Exam Schedule Maker to avoid the guess and check process by taking teacher's names, frees, and departments as well as the AP Exam schedule and returning the potential list of proctors for each exam that Ms. Berman could then use to determine who she would like to proctor.
